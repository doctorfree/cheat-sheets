# MISP

The MISP Threat Sharing project consists of multiple initiatives, from software to facilitate threat analysis and sharing to freely usable structured Cyber Threat Information and Taxonomies.

MISP (Open Source Threat Intelligence and Sharing Platform) software facilitates the exchange and sharing of threat intelligence, Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) about targeted malware and attacks, financial fraud or any intelligence within your community of trusted members. MISP sharing is a distributed model containing technical and non-technical information which can be shared within closed, semi-private or open communities. 

Exchanging such information should result in faster detection of targeted attacks and improve the detection ratio, whilst also reducing the number of false positives.
