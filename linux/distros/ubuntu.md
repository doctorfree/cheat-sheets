# Ubuntu

Ubuntu is a Linux distribution based on Debian and composed mostly of free and open-source software.Ubuntu is officially released in three editions: Desktop, Server, and Core for Internet of things devices and robots. Ubuntu is a popular operating system for cloud computing, with support for OpenStack.

Ubuntu is developed by British company Canonical, and a community of other developers, under a meritocratic governance model. Canonical provides security updates and support for each Ubuntu release, starting from the release date and until the release reaches its designated end-of-life date. Canonical generates revenue through the sale of premium services related to Ubuntu and donations from those who download the Ubuntu software.

Ubuntu is named after the Nguni philosophy of [ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy), which Canonical indicates means "humanity to others" with a connotation of "I am what I am because of who we all are".
