# Arch Linux

Arch Linux is an independently developed, x86-64 general-purpose Linux distribution that strives to provide the latest stable versions of most software by following a rolling-release model. The default installation is a minimal base system, configured by the user to only add what is purposely required.

Pacman, a package manager written specifically for Arch Linux, is used to install, remove and update software packages.

Arch Linux uses a rolling release model, meaning there are no "major releases" of completely new versions of the system; a regular system update is all that is needed to obtain the latest Arch software; the installation images released every month by the Arch team are simply up-to-date snapshots of the main system components.

Arch Linux has comprehensive documentation, consisting of a community-run wiki known as the ArchWiki.
