## Overview

The Cheat Sheets Plus repository is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault containing cheat sheets, project information, documentation, code snippets, and other useful information in markdown format. The main feature of this knowledge base repository is that the markdown files have been manicured to contain internal backlinks and tags thus exposing their inter-relationships. It's a knowledge base with metadata providing insight.

It can be viewed using any markdown viewer (e.g. almost any browser) but if Obsidian is used then many additional features will be available including queries using the [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

This knowledge base has been developed through the efforts of several individuals. It is licensed under the [MIT open source license](LICENSE) and can be shared freely as long as the individual copyrights are retained. Please feel free to contribute with additional cheat sheets and documentation, corrections, suggestions, enhancements, or simply buy us a cup of coffee.

These are the release notes for Version 1.0.0 Release 2 of the Cheat Sheets Plus vault.
