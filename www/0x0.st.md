# 0x0.st

The following documentation of the website at `0x0.st` can be
retrieved with the command `curl https://0x0.st/`.

A convenience alias for uploading files to `0x0.st`:

```shell
alias upload='curl -F "file=@$(ls | fzf)" https://0x0.st'
```

Similar services are offered by several other sites. For example:

```shell
curl --upload-file ./hello.txt https://transfer.sh/hello.txt
```
<pre>
https://transfer.sh/ayJ0YS/hello.txt
</pre>

## 0x0 DOCUMENTATION

HTTP POST files here:

```shell
    curl -F'file=@yourfile.png' https://0x0.st
```
You can also POST remote URLs:

```shell
    curl -F'url=http://example.com/image.jpg' https://0x0.st
```
If you don't want the resulting URL to be easy to guess:

```shell
    curl -F'file=@yourfile.png' -Fsecret= https://0x0.st
    curl -F'url=http://example.com/image.jpg' -Fsecret= https://0x0.st
```

It is possible to append your own file name to the URL:
```
    https://0x0.st/aaa.jpg/image.jpeg
```

URL SHORTENING HAS BEEN DISABLED DUE TO FREQUENT ABUSE

File URLs are valid for at least 30 days and up to a year (see below).

Files can be set to expire sooner by adding an "expires" parameter (in hours)
```shell
    curl -F'file=@yourfile.png' -Fexpires=24 https://0x0.st
```
OR by setting "expires" to a timestamp in epoch milliseconds
```shell
    curl -F'file=@yourfile.png' -Fexpires=1681996320000 https://0x0.st
```

Expired files won't be removed immediately, but will be removed as part of
the next hourly purge.

Whenever a file that does not already exist or has expired is uploaded,
the HTTP response header includes an X-Token field. You can use this
to perform management operations on the file.

To delete the file immediately:
```shell
    curl -Ftoken=token_here -Fdelete= https://0x0.st/abc.txt
```
To change the expiration date (see above):
```shell
    curl -Ftoken=token_here -Fexpires=3 https://0x0.st/abc.txt
```

Maximum file size: `512.0 MiB`

Not allowed: `application/x-dosexec`, `application/x-executable`, `application/x-sharedlib`, `application/x-hdf5`, `application/java-archive`, `application/vnd.android.package-archive`, `application/x-rar`
