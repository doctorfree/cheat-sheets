# How can I contribute to the Guide?

**If you have a Github account**, you can simply submit a [pull request](https://github.com/joyeusenoelle/GuideToMastodon/pulls) if you've made a change to the text that you'd like me to consider, or open an [issue](https://github.com/joyeusenoelle/GuideToMastodon/issues) if there's something you'd like to request but you haven't made the change to the text.

I do review all issues and pull requests that are submitted, but because of health issues it might take me a few days. If you haven't heard back in a week, please drop me a note to remind me!

**If you don't have a Github account**, please email me at `noelle AT noelle.codes` to suggest changes to the Guide!

## Is there anything in particular you're looking for?

Right now, what the Guide needs most is translations into other languages besides English. My knowledge of most non-English languages isn't strong enough to translate the text myself, and I welcome any multilingual readers to take matters into their own hands! (You may note that this is the lone standing issue that I haven't resolved!)
